\chapter{ROS}
    
    
\section{Names}
    see \url{https://wiki.ros.org/Names}
    
    Name structures are as follow:
    /<namespace>/<node or topic or service>
    such as /uav1/odometry/odom\_gps in which uav1 is a namespace and odometry is a sub namespace va \texttt{odom\_gps} is topic final name.
    subname space doesnt exist in ROS jargon. It is just for explanation

\section{TF}
    A package responsible for managing and publishing coordinate frames and transformation between them.
    
    TF keeps all the frames in a directed tree called ''Transform tree''
    
    
    map is coming from GPS which is from world frame. base\_link is robots body and lidar\_link as well
    map → odom → base\_link → lidar\_link
    
    \paragraph{time\_stamped}
        Each transform is published with timestamp
        
    
\section{Messages}
    \subsection{geometry\_msgs}
    \subsection{nav\_msgs}
        \paragraph{Odometry}
            has Pose of 7 dimensions (3 for position and 4 quaternions) and 6 as twist or velocity (3 linear velocity and 3 angular)
    \subsection{sensor\_msgs}
        \paragraph{LaserScan}
    \subsection{diagnostic\_msgs}
    \subsection{actionlib\_msgs}
\section{Topics}
    Is a communication channel to which nodes can publish messages or subscribe for messages

    \paragraph{Notes}
        They are ros runtime proccesses
        \begin{itemize}
            \item each topic can have as many publishers and subscribers that you need but the message types must be always the same
        \end{itemize}
\section{Node}
    Node a piece of runable code in ROS. It is either a c++/python code or a Gazebo plugin
\section{RQT Graph}
    Is a visual tool that shows nodes as boxes and topics as ovals and the direction of the edges show publisher and subscriber nodes
\section{RQT console}
    To visualize logs
\section{Bags}
\section{Frames}
\section{Parameters}
\section{Services}
    request-response communication form. Such as calling gazebo/get\_model\_state and getting models location
\section{Action}
Is a combination of services and topics for a longterm task with feedback

\section{rviz}
    For visualizing data from sensors

\section{Goal}
\section{MAVROS}
\section{MAVLINK}
\section{QGroundControl}
\section{Flight controller}
    It is the hardware board and it usually contains
    \begin{itemize}
        \item IMU
        \item Barometer (for height)
        \item GNSS
        \item Microcontroller/cpu
        \item I/O ports
    \end{itemize}

    examples:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pixhawk
        \item Cubeorange
        \item Holybro
    \end{itemize}

\section{Autopilot}
    \subsection{PX4}
        \subsection{PXmini}
    \subsection{Ardupilot}
