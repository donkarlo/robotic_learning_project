    \subsection{Propplers}
        \paragraph{Pitch}
            the distance the proppler moves the air forward in one full rotation.
            The \theta is the rotation dependent on the distance to the center of the proppler
            \[
            \text{Pitch}(r) = 2\pi r \times \tan\big(\theta(r)\big)
            \]

    \subsubsection{Brushless rotors}
        \paragraph{ECG (Electronic Speed COntroller)}
            provides the engine with patterns for it three phases as it has three magnetofields to connect voltage to each at once
        \paragraph{PWM (Pulse with Modulation)}
            is to determine how longe the voltage is established in microseconds
